	<h4 class="byline">Story by <a href="mailto:jschwartz@statesman.com">Jeremy Schwartz</a>, American-Statesman Staff</h4>
 	<h4 style="text-transform: none;">Sept. 7, 2014</h4>
	<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the morning of July 1, 2008, Department of Veterans Affairs officials gathered to unveil a state-of-the-art brain scanner they predicted would help revolutionize the understanding of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder in combat veterans.</p>
	<p>The timing, and location, seemed perfect. One of the first studies would scan nearby Fort Hood soldiers before and after they deployed to war in Iraq or Afghanistan — a unique opportunity to study physical changes in soldiers’ brains due to combat.</p>
	<p>Six years later, the $3.6 million machine sits unused in an out-of-the way corner at the Olin E. Teague Veterans Medical Center in Temple.</p>

	<?php include "tease-comments.html";?>

	<p>Not a single study based on the machine’s scans has been published.</p>
	<p>Not a single veteran has received improved treatment because of advances ushered in by the scanner.</p>
	<p>The machine has sat dormant for the past three years, plagued by a series of delays caused by mismanagement, mechanical failures and bureaucratic roadblocks. Officials at the Waco Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans, which oversees the program, aborted the scanner’s first and only brain study in 2011 when they declared its image quality too poor to use.</p>
	<p>In a grim internal assessment, the center’s associate research director, Dena Davidson, wrote in March 2013: <span id="dct01" class="dcnote">“I think there should be serious consideration of returning the MRI from where it came because we do not have the expertise to use it or care for it.” [Click to see source document.]</span></p>
	<div id="dc01">
		<div id="DC-note-166326" class="DC-note-container"></div><script src="//s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/notes/loader.js"></script><script>  dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202679-researchagreementsaga/annotations/166326.js');</script>
		<br>
	</div>
	<p>The scanner idles 24 hours a day because it’s more expensive to turn an MRI machine off and on than to keep it running. A full-time technician diligently performs daily maintenance checks on the unit.</p>
	<p>By early 2014, VA staffers were seeking alternative purposes for what was once envisioned as support space for the multimillion-dollar scanner.</p>
	<p>One idea: housing for lab rats.</p>
	<p>“Can I store my 14 rodent housing racks (2’x6’x7’) in there?” one VA employee asked colleagues in a January email. “This is not a joke.”</p>

	<?php include "video-edwards.html";?>

	<p>It was an inglorious decline for a machine once hailed by VA leaders as the most powerful mobile MRI on the planet. The scanner, housed in a semi-truck trailer, was supposed to travel between Fort Hood, the nation’s busiest deployment hub for war-bound soldiers, and the VA hospitals in Temple and Waco.</p>
	<p>Internal VA emails, reports and documents detail a program that was bungled almost from the start. Yet the story of how one of the agency’s most powerful diagnostic tools devolved into a ghost machine also stands as a stark symbol of the VA’s shortcomings in responding to the specialized needs of soldiers returning from the longest-running conflicts in the country’s history.</p>
	<p>“Everyone involved in this effort felt this was a unique opportunity to help our troops, not just at Fort Hood, but throughout the country,” said former U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, who had worked to bring the center and mobile MRI to Waco. “I had hopes that this project would work at a time when troops were still deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. I don’t understand why that didn’t happen. There may be a good reason. I simply do not know.”</p>

	<h3>VA research arm escapes public scrutiny</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n recent months, a burgeoning national scandal over how long veterans have to wait for medical care has spurred congressional and criminal investigations and toppled the former VA secretary. Lawmakers have also probed the agency’s disproportionate use of painkillers, high rate of veteran suicide and massive backlogs of disability claims.</p>
	
	<?php include "graphic-deploytbiptsd.html";?>

	<p>The scrutiny, however, has largely ignored the VA’s $2 billion-a-year research arm. A 10-month American-Statesman investigation suggests that the VA’s research arm, charged with developing the military’s treatments of the future, also merits close examination.</p>
	<p>The newspaper reviewed <a href="document-list.php" target="_blank">more than a thousand pages of documents</a> obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and interviewed six former and current employees of the Center of Excellence, which was to house the mobile MRI and oversee the research.</p>
	<p>The documents and interviews show that leaders took charge of the scanner without a clear plan for success and then were unable to recruit enough researchers, as staffing at the center fell to just 15 employees in January despite initial plans for 75. Later, administrators became mired in red tape; internal VA squabbles paralyzed the imaging program after workers appeared close to restarting research in 2012 — delays that launched a cascade of new problems. The Waco center lost at least seven federally funded grants for what researchers hoped would be groundbreaking brain injury research.</p>
	<p>“They didn’t want people to know how much of a failure it was,” said one former Center of Excellence employee, who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation from the VA. “Unless someone says something, they will think it’s OK to do what they’ve done and continue to do.”</p>
	<p>The program’s failures came just as it was needed most. Since 2008, more than 150,000 U.S. service members have returned from war with diagnoses of PTSD or TBI. Yet research has yielded few significant advancements in treatment of the two maladies, experts say.</p>
	<p>For many vets, “PTSD or TBI are factors in their inability to reintegrate — they come back a changed person, they know it, but they can’t identify why,” said Steve Hernandez, the McLennan County veterans service officer. “To know we had seven years where we could have helped find breakthroughs in understanding, that’s disheartening.”</p>

	<?php include "tease-va-brain-austin.html";?>

	<p>	Waco resident Timothy Priddy, who suffered a traumatic brain injury when he deployed to Iraq with Fort Hood’s 1st Cavalry Division in 2004, wonders if the scanner could have led to advances that might have helped him get better treatment.</p>
	<p>“The way they were talking, (the scanner) could see more thoroughly into the brain and better detect brain injuries and everything,” Priddy, 35, said. “(The center’s failures) were a slap to all veterans that go out there. There’s no telling how many Vietnam veterans have TBIs.”</p>
	<p>The tumult at the Waco Center of Excellence also caps nearly a decade of VA futility in Central Texas when it comes to researching brain injuries. Five years ago, the VA shut down research at a similar program at the University of Texas in Austin — the Brain Injury and Recovery Laboratory, which didn’t scan a single veteran before its assets were transferred to Waco. Between them, the two imaging programs cost taxpayers more than $12 million and squandered almost a decade of opportunity.</p>
	<p>Today, VA officials say they are trying to revive the Waco program and find a researcher to take charge of the troubled scanner. They have hired a new center director, added employees and hope to eventually grow to 50 staffers.</p>
	<p>“You know, I can do what I can do,” said the center’s new director Michael Russell. “I’ll get it going, and I think there’s going to be a continuing (operational) tempo of deployments for at least some time. It will be smaller numbers, but there will still be deployers.”</p>
	<p>The VA did not respond to a request for comment from administrators who oversaw the program during the previous six years.</p>

	<h3>New understanding of brain function</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile the VA is best known for providing health care and disability benefits to veterans, it also operates one of the nation’s largest research operations. With unique access to millions of veterans and their medical records, the VA in 2014 spent $586 million on research and prosthetics and oversaw nearly $2 billion in total research funding.</p>
	<p>In 2015, the VA plans to spend about $35 million — or less than 6 percent of its research budget — on TBI and neurotrauma study nationwide. The most advanced research occurs at specialized mental illness centers such as the Waco Center of Excellence, which opened at a time when increasingly powerful scanning instruments were revolutionizing how the medical profession viewed the brain.</p>

	<p>“For much of the last three to four decades, (research) was predicated on the idea that brains can’t heal,” said Jim Misko, a former board member of the Brain Injury Association of America. “But in the last 10 years, that’s been completely replaced by the data driven, informed view that a lot of damage from concussion or TBI isn’t black and white. It’s not a question of healthy vs. dead tissue. Most of the damage is in between, in tissue that can be repaired. Now the lid is off with people (wanting) to do research.”</p>
	<p>He added, “If you have access to the best imaging, you’re getting to see damage where we could never see it before.”</p>
	<p>But few brain injury studies in recent years have scanned soldiers before and after deployments. Such a comparison would allow researchers to observe changes in individual soldiers’ brains as the result of exposure to war.</p>
	<p>“It’s a perfect study design,” said Martha Shenton, director of the Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory at Harvard University and scientist at the VA Boston Healthcare System. “The gold standard is the pre-deployed brain.”</p>
	<p>Waco’s research plans represented more than just a better understanding of PTSD and TBI; they were part of an effort to resuscitate the sprawling, 75-year-old Waco VA complex, which officials had targeted for closure in 2003. Thanks to local veterans advocates and lawmakers, a federal panel recommended in 2005 that the red brick buildings in Waco not only be kept open, but expanded. At the 2008 ceremony, Edwards declared: “This is like the phoenix rising from the ashes.”</p>
	<p>The centerpiece of the rebirth was the Philips Achieva Quasar mobile MRI unit. The VA hailed the unit as “the world’s most powerful research (mobile) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine.” It featured a magnet twice as strong as nearly every other mobile unit at the time, which should have given researchers greater speed and image detail.</p>
	<p>“They were swinging for the fences,” said Russell. “There’s only half a dozen of those ever built. So this was like pushing the limits of science, right?”</p>

	<div class="caption art">One of the reasons the Center of Excellence acquired a mobile MRI machine was to move it between Fort Hood in Killeen and VA centers in Temple and Waco, but the moves proved costlier than first imagined, and the marriage of MRI to trailer resulted in vibrations that caused poor image quality. JAY JANNER / AMERICAN-STATESMAN</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="body-text">
	<h3>Trouble from the beginning</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 2009, the VA signed an agreement with Fort Hood to study soldiers before and after they deployed to war. An early contract called for the scanner to make up to 100 trips per year to scan veterans and soldiers.</p>
	<p>Yet moving the scanner, giving researchers access to more subjects, proved problematic.</p>
	<p>Technical problems surfaced almost immediately. Images suffered from “artifacts” or lines and spots caused by vibrations and other disruptions in the scanner’s magnetic field.</p>
	<p>In a statement to the Statesman, Philips said the scanner suffered from “out-of-specification environmental conditions at the site that affected system performance,” but wouldn’t elaborate. The OshKosh Corp., which manufactured the trailer, didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>
	<p>“You have to recalibrate it, anything in the environment has be factored, it has to be shimmed,” Russell said, adding that it costs thousands of dollars each time it is moved. “So you don’t move it that often,” he said.</p>

	<?php include "tease-va-brain-history.html";?>

	<p>At the same time, the Center of Excellence was struggling to find a neuroimaging director and recruiting imaging researchers.</p>
	<p>“They ventured into MRI research projects without having anyone on board who knew what they were doing,” said another former center employee, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation for speaking out. “They threw money at it, but didn’t have anyone in place to get it going. Waco was a tough draw, but a congressman pushed for it in Waco, and so that forced the VA to try and bring people there. It’s hard to build a program from scratch.”</p>
	<p>The employee added that the imaging problems came after the VA failed to conduct proper acceptance testing, which is routinely done to determine if a new research scanner is working as the manufacturer claims.</p>
	<p>“It’s all good intentions,” Russell said. But “by the time we actually had somebody on board who could do those studies, a period of time had already passed. But that’s the difference between being a startup organization and purchasing something for an existing institution.”</p>

	<h3>Shut it down</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he scanner’s first project was a study seeking to determine the genetic and physical root causes of PTSD, conducted by Keith Young, who served as acting director of the neuroimaging program, even though, colleagues said, he had little imaging experience. By early 2011, Young had scanned more than 200 veterans with the machine, according to VA documents.</p>

		<?php include "photo-gulliversteelelittle.html";?>

	<p>But the image quality was so concerning that in March 2011 the VA brought in an outside expert, Deborah Little, the director of MRI research at the University of Illinois-Chicago, to investigate, according to documents.</p>
	<p>Little’s verdict was devastating: The scanner wasn’t capable of conducting the research it had been purchased to do and needed massive repair. The center’s then-director, Suzy Gulliver, immediately shut down the PTSD study and suspended research on the scanner. (Greg Harrington, an MRI physicist and former researcher at the center, disputed Little’s assessment, saying that when he left the VA in May 2011, the scanner was “fully capable” of performing most research.)</p>
	<p>In July 2011, the scanner suffered a massive failure called a quench, in which the liquid helium used to cool the powerful magnet was released as a gas after the scanner’s cooling system failed. Unplanned quenches can permanently damage magnets or lead to repeated quenching, and in this case it required several weeks of repair.</p>
	<p>The next month, Little joined the VA to permanently oversee the machine and imaging program. A press release announcing her hiring made no mention of the dire situation facing the center’s signature piece of equipment.</p>
	<p>For much of the next year, Philips repaired and redesigned the scanner, at no cost to the VA. The machine was finally returned to the VA at the end of 2012.</p>

	<p>For over a year, Little and her staff haggled over the agreement, with no success. Her biggest obstacle wasn’t Philips, but her colleagues: According to internal VA emails, the VA’s own contracting officials in Illinois refused to release the documents that Center of Excellence staffers needed to execute the agreement.</p>
	<p><span id="dct02" class="dcnote">“We cannot conduct research on our MRI until we have a research agreement in place,” Little wrote to her contracting colleagues in a Jan. 7, 2013, email. “This is a critical issue.”</span></p>

		<br>
	</div>
	<p>Little, who in an internal memo called her relationship with contracting and legal officials “adversarial at best,” said the resulting delays cost half a dozen studies that might otherwise have been done — a malaise that bogged down the program’s work even more.</p>
	<p><span id="dct03" class="dcnote">“Because of the events of the last year, there has been no recruitment attempted to fill support positions in the Neuroimaging and Genetics Core,” she wrote in a February 2013 report. “As such, the Core is woefully and completely understaffed and no other scientists have been trained on management of the MRI.”</span></p>

		<br>
	</div>
	<p>A month later, Little resigned, leaving the program in total disarray.</p>
	<p>“We are at a complete loss for managing this unit without an expert and as far as I understand, Dr. Little was the only person in the VA who had the knowledge to manage this specialized equipment,” the center’s interim director, Mira Brancu, wrote in July 2013.</p>
	<p>Potential partners outside the center began to take notice of the internal struggles. Baylor University researchers had been eager to use the scanner as a key part of their investigation into the array of poorly understood symptoms facing Gulf War veterans. But in April 2013, they decided to pull the plug.</p>
	<p><span id="dct04" class="dcnote">“We’re hoping to start patient recruitment this summer, and really can’t afford additional delays,” Baylor’s Lea Steele wrote to Davidson, the associate research director. “I am also very sorry to add something else to the list of bad news that you and everyone there has been dealing with for so long.”</span></p>
	<div id="dc04">
		<div id="DC-note-166305" class="DC-note-container"></div><script src="//s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/notes/loader.js"></script><script>  dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202680-loseresearch/annotations/166305.js');</script>
		<br>
	</div>
	<p>Davidson’s reply reflected the growing feeling of gloom at the center. <span id="dct05" class="dcnote">“Indeed I suspect it will be many months before we have everything in place to use the MRI,” she wrote. “So I think you are making a very wise choice. I only regret if we in any way contributed to the delay of your research.”</span></p>

		<br>
	</div>
	<p>In fact, without Little, VA officials were soon forced to acknowledge that not only did they not know how to use the sophisticated machine — they had no idea if it was functional at all after its long period of inactivity.</p>
	<p>Two months later, the scanner suffered its third quench.</p>

	<h3>Other problems at Waco center</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he problems in the imaging program were among wider issues plaguing the Center of Excellence. A $10 million permanent home for the center was supposed to debut in 2011; three years later it still hasn’t opened, leaving staffers in temporary quarters. In early 2013, Gulliver, the center director who had hired Little, left the VA under a <span id="dct08" class="dcnote">cloud of allegations over dubious financial transactions related to recruiting and outside grants.</span></p>
	<div id="dc08">
		<div id="DC-note-166294" class="DC-note-container"></div><script src="//s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/notes/loader.js"></script><script>  dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1219436-inspector-general-report-on-suzy-gulliver/annotations/166294.js');</script>
		<br>
	</div>
	<p>A series of VA employees serving as interim directors took over the troubled center. The first, Brancu, expressed distress upon learning the full extent of problems with the scanner.</p>
	<p><span id="dct06" class="dcnote">“We have been left with a multimillion-dollar unique mobile MRI unit that is not being overseen by an expert and not being utilized for research,” she wrote in July 2013.</span> The day before she handed off her interim directorship to her replacement, Jennifer Runnals, Brancu added: “I think at this point, we are concerned about whether this magnet is in any condition to be used.”</p>
	<div id="dc06">
		<div id="DC-note-166301" class="DC-note-container"></div><script src="//s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/notes/loader.js"></script><script>  dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202681-lossofexpertise/annotations/166301.js');</script>
		<br>
	</div>
	<p>For her part, Runnals conceded she knew little about the sophisticated machine she’d inherited. “It became apparent to me that my lack of expertise regarding MRIs would be a significant obstacle,” she wrote.</p>

			</div>
	</div>  

	<p>She contacted the VA’s other MRI experts for assistance. But her colleagues were no help: “Despite several emails I received no response or assistance prior to my term,” she said in a report.</p>
	<p>So Runnals next turned to the University of Texas — where the VA had halted research at the Brain Injury and Recovery Lab three years earlier. “What I am looking for is to run some information by a person who knows how magnets function, their upkeep etc.,” she wrote to UT professor Jeff Luci.</p>
	<p>Luci’s prognosis was grim: <span id="dct07" class="dcnote">“Once a magnet starts quenching, the pattern usually repeats itself,” he wrote. “I doubt you’ve seen the last quench.”</span></p>

	<h3>The future</h3>
	<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>arlier this year, the VA hired Russell, who had previously overseen the Army’s TBI screening program, as a permanent director for the Center of Excellence. Russell said he has doubled the staff and has found someone to oversee the neuroimaging program — though he’ll start with modest expectations.</p>
	<p>“His challenge is going to be to make the machine function properly,” Russell said. He conceded that it’s still not clear if the vibration problem has been solved or if it can ever be used as originally intended. Russell added the machine might have to be taken out of its trailer and bolted to the ground.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, he has suggested using it to conduct simple medical scans on veterans to reduce wait times for patients. “It’s available if somebody wants it,” Russell said. “It hurts me to see it sitting there, honestly. I wish we could be using it clinically.”</p>
	<p>So far, however, Central Texas VA leaders have declined.</p>
	<p>Russell said he hopes the eventual completion of the Center of Excellence’s permanent home will help recruiting.</p>
	<p>“It’s hard to do that kind of cutting edge science without the right facilities,” he said. “We have to give people the infrastructure to be able to do it. … I’m pretty comfortable that if we build it right, it’ll fly. It’s just not ready yet.”<p>

		<p>Investigative reporter Jeremy Schwartz received a tip late last year about failures at the Waco Center of Excellence and submitted a wide-ranging Freedom of Information request to the VA in January. In addition to the more than 1,000 pages of documents received through the request, Schwartz interviewed several current and former employees at the center, most of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the VA.</p>
		<p>Schwartz has reported extensively about military and veterans issues and broke the news earlier this year about manipulation of wait time data at Central Texas VA medical facilities. He was also part of the team that produced the Uncounted Casualties project, which investigated how 266 Texas veterans died after coming home and won the 2013 Military Reporters and Editors Association award for domestic coverage.</p>
