This is code for the immersive story about the mobile MRI machine owned by Veteran's Affairs Center of Excellence in Waco.

The story is by Jeremy Schwartz of the Austin American-Statesman, with photos by Jay Janner and Kelly West. The online production was done by Christian McDonald.

It is built on the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework, the Slick gallery and some added code to support DocumentCloud embeds.
