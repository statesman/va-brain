This is code for the [immersive story](http://projects.statesman.com/news/va-center-of-excellence/) about the mobile MRI machine owned by Veteran's Affairs Center of Excellence in Waco.

The story is by Jeremy Schwartz of the Austin American-Statesman, with photos by Jay Janner and Kelly West. The online production was done by Christian McDonald.

It is built on the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework, and uses the [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) gallery and contains some added code to support [DocumentCloud](http://documentcloud.org) embeds.
